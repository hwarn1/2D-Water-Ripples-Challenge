# 2D-Water-Ripples-Challenge
Creative Coding Challenge following video and code by Professor Dan Shiffman

### sketch.js  
This is where my base code is stored. This code is essientially an exact replica of Prof. Shiffman's JavaScript 2D Water Ripples code.

### mySketch.js  
This is where my refactored code is stored. This code began as the base code, but I altered it and addded new functions so that it is more exciting and can display new features such as scenes, colour changes, different intensity, and reverse ripples.

### index.html & style.css
This is where the base html and css code from P5.js is stored. I did not change these, as they are merely a foundation for my code which focuses on the JavaScript elements of programming.
